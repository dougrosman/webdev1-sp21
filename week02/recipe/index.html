    <h1>In-class exercise: Invent a recipe</h1>
    <p>Invent a recipe for a made-up dish. Create a web page for that recipe that includes the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A title</li>
        <li>An image</li>
        <li>A corny backstory</li>
        <li>An ingredients list</li>
        <li>A list of instructions</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p> Make sure to use semantic HTML (meaning, you should use the elements that make the most sense for each section!). You should create the following page in a fresh Codepen called *HTML Recipe*</p>
