### Homework
1. Using HTML only, create a web page for a fake business that you make up! What does your business offer? What sections and links does it have? The goal of this assignment is to build a semantic website. Create meaningful sections, and structure your HTML with the appropriate elements.
**Hints:** Look at regular websites with CSS turned off to see what type of content a website has, without being distracted by the styling.

    1. Run your code through an HTML validator and correct any errors
    1. If you're still having issues, try googling the problem you're having
    1. If you're still having issues, reach out to a friend, a peer, a tutor, or me with your issue. Use the [Troubleshooting Guide](../guides/troubleshooting) to make sure you're asking questions in a way that best helps others to help you!
