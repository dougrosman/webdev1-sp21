# Advanced positioning

## **Summary**
Recreate the web page for this article on The Verge: [Cabin Pressure: The Turbulent History of Flight Attendants](https://www.theverge.com/22258257/flight-attendants-history-covid-pandemic-airline-industry-aviation)

## **Guidelines**
Using the things we learned in class over the last couple weeks, try your best to reverse engineer this website. This will draw on your new knowledge of CSS positioning, and highlights the use of *`position: sticky`*;

### **Setup**
1. Inside your **assignments** folder in your webdev1 repo, create a folder called **cabin_pressure**.
2. Inside that folder, create your `index.html` and `style.css` files.
3. Make sure your `style.css` file is link to your `index.html` file in the `<head>` section.
4. Make sure all your image files are renamed to have no spaces and lowercase letters only

### **How to get full credit**
1. Make your website look and function as close as possible to the original website. This time, there are no requirements around which elements you have to use, though I ask that you try to be as semantic as possible.
2. Make sure your code does not have any errors (I will be using an HTML AND a CSS validator when I grade this, so make sure you run your code through a validator before submitting it!) (if you have any errors, you will lose one point)
3. Make sure your code is neat/indented nicely (you will lose one point if your code is messy)
4. The link you submit to Canvas should be correct. (you will lose one point if the link you submit does not go to the correct web page)

### **How to submit**
Push your changes to GitHub, and submit the correct link to this assignment. If you need a refresher on how to do that, you can revist the video I created for CSS Basics assignment. I suggest [starting the video at 11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88QYmFPqAkA&t=671s)
