# Webdev1 - Week 11 - 04/05/21
## Catch-up + one-on-one meetings

## Agenda
### Part I: Getting Started
#### 1. Hellos
   1. Close other apps
   2. Look over your comments/grades
   3. Late policy update: Assignments more than a week old can still be turned in for up to **6** points now.
   4. Ask questions
   5. Office hours this week (Friday, 4/5/21, 3:00pm-4:00pm CST). This time slot is open to both sections.

### Part II: Open-ended assignment + one-on-one meetings
Class today is a "catch-up" day. I won't be lecturing on any new material. Today in class, you'll work on this week's assignment or catch-up on assignments you have not turned in. I'll be meeting with each of one-on-one for a few minutes to check in and see how you're doing.

#### 1a. Open-time (when I'm not meeting with you)
  1. If you're all caught up and want to get started on this week's assignments, go for it. Assignment 10 is a completely open-ended assignment. Make a web page about anything you want, using any sort of tools. Use this as an opportunity to practice things we've learned in class, as well as an opportunity to try new things. Of course, no matter what you do, make sure your code is error-free, all your links work, and your code is indented consistently. There are also freecodecamp tutorials for this week.
  2. If you'd rather catch up on past assignments, spend your time in class doing that. You'll have time to ask additional questions when after one-on-one meetings.

### 1b. One-on-one meetings.
   1. The order I'll be meeting with each of you has been pre-determined, and will be visible from my shared screen.
   2. Depending on your needs, I'll meet with each of you for somewhere between 3-8 minutes.
   3. **Our time for each meeting is brief, so make sure that if you have any specific code questions, your code is already pulled up and ready to go.**

### Homework
   1. 10a: Freecodecamp tutorials: CSS Grid
   2. 10b: Freestyle Web Page
