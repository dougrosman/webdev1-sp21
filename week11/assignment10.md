# Assignment 10 - Open-ended assignment

## **Summary**
Make a web page about anything you want, using any tools you'd like.

## **Guidelines**
Since this is open-ended, there are no minimum technical requirements, except that you should have at least 1 HTML file, and 1 CSS file. Just have fun with this, and build something that interests you. This is an opportunity to practice what we've learned, and to try new things. This site should be linked to from the home page of your webdev1 website.

## **How to get full credit**
I will take off one point for each of these that is not satisfied:
1. Have 1 HTML file
2. Have 1 CSS file
3. There is a link to your web page on your webdev1 homepage
4. Your HTML has 0 errors (Run your code throug a [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input))
5. Your CSS has 0 errors
6. The link you submit to Canvas is the correct link
